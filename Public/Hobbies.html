<p>I like learning new skills and recently I have been interested in exploring different languages as they help me explore new cultures around the world. I started learning Spanish online and I have already cleared the beginner level. 
I generally spend my weekends focusing on exploring new Spanish words and watching Spanish movies to strengthen my grasp over the language.</p>
<p>I usually spend my leisure time reading books or playing badminton. I like reading new and trending novels and my favourite genres include suspense, horror and thriller novels. 
Being a voracious reader, I believe that I have a strong vocabulary and knowledge of grammar. My zeal for writing gets its flair from my passion for reading books.</p>
<p>Composing music and songwriting has been my favourite pastime since I was in high school. I have my own garage band with a few of my high school classmates and we spend our free weekends and holidays composing new tunes and performing at open clubs.</p>
